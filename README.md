# DefensiveCyberOperations
Project for Defensive Cyber Operations(CYBR 3100)
This was the end of semester final group project for CYBR 3100.

As a group, we were given a virtual network with no knowledge of it besides the number of targets.
Using the skills we learned in class, we were to find the targets IPs, gain access to them,find vulnerabilities, achieve root access
and find hints and clues to find hidden flags that were in tough to reach spots around the network.
